    <h2>Original Javascript and DHTML combine</h2>
    <p>As suggest that I could combine them together so I did just that, because my website is mainly focusing on tourism, I don't think I added something silly, 
        as when user needed a more detail look of the map, which mainly a picture on my web page, picture enlargement should be helpfull. What I did was using Java script 
        to handle the 'mouserover' and 'mouseout' event so user can interact with the image, it is original, not using any plugins or pre-built function per requirement. 
        When mouserover trigger, the Javascript function mouseroverEnlarge will happen, increasing the width and height of the image to make the picture bigger. 
        When user move the mouse away, trigger an mouseout, which trigger the mouseoutOriginalSize happen return the images to the intended size orgiinally. I use this script for all 
        of my pages which would be consistent</p>
    <h2>Extra</h2>
    <li>I added an captcha, though I don't know if it work, I put it in the comments form page, 
        I just follow instruction on the website, it would be helpfull if you give me more insight</li>
    <li>I added an favicon, a ico file of an airplane I found free online, the plane symbolise for travelling, which is the purpose of my website</li>
