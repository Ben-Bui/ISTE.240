                This is the website where I take the map for my homepage, as this map is small but easy and descriptive, and some information
                about the Thames, like why this location would the Roman chose to settle down. The website was last updated Oct 11, 2023,
                this website was also serve as a newspaper of sort.</p>

            <p> The information I got from this website is London history, how was it found, what date did the great fire happen 
                specific date and such for my history section on my homepage, and how London transform from what happen from WW2 to now.

            <p> For this website, I use information such as what is present at the museum like 
                the Elgin Marbles, Rosetta Stone, to present the information for the user. I also use 
                contact information on this website, highlight information, and galleries link 
                so user can see it for themselve, it was recently updated since this is a live service website
                but no date was posted so can't tell for sure when.</p>

            <p>Fun fact I did a tour here last year so most of the information still fresh because this place is amazing, but
                I use the website for specific date, number, adress, email, of such. The stuff about amotsphere, the summer
                is my own experience, but I did look it up in the website. I also use the highlight of the place, shedule, one of the palace picture, and must
                know information, because despite it a tour place, it still a palace of royalty there are rules.
