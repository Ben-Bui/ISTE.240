        <div class="history">
            <h1> A bit history of London</h1>
            <p> London's history spans over two thousand years. Its began when Roman settlement 
                called "Londinium" around AD 43. This strategic town 
                grew as a bustling trading hub on the banks of the River Thames.
                In medieval times, London's fame increased, and 
                it became the capital of England. The Tower of London, 
                constructed in the 11th century, served both as a royal 
                palace and a prison. By the Tudor era, London was a 
                thriving metropolis.
                <br>
                The Great Fire of 1666, though destructive, cleared the 
                way for the architectural innovations of Sir 
                Christopher Wren. His designs gave London its 
                vey distinctive skyline.
                <br>
                During the 18th and 19th centuries, London 
                was at the heart of the British Empire. 
                The Victorian era brought immense growth and cultural 
                richness. Innovations like the London Underground and 
                famous literary works became part of its heritage.
                <br>
                The 20th century brought both world wars, with London 
                enduring heavy bombing during the Blitz in World War II. 
                The post-war period saw the city's redevelopment and 
                modernization.
                <br>
                Today, London is a dynamic global city, home to diverse 
                cultures and ethnicities. It's a financial powerhouse, a 
                center for the arts, and a place of innovation, 
                preserving its rich history while embracing the modern era.</p>
